The Objective of this repository is to share the tasks assigned during my **Oasis Infobyte internship** in the field of **data science**. It serves as a platform to publish and showcase the projects and assignments I have completed throughout the internship. By making this repository accessible, **I aim to demonstrate my skills and progress in data science** to potential employers and the wider community. Additionally, it allows for collaboration and feedback from others interested in data science, fostering a learning and growth environment.

The tasks I have been assigned include:

Task 1: **Iris Flower Classification**

Task 2: **Unemployment Analysis with Python**

Task 3: **Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**


These tasks provide an opportunity for me to apply various data science techniques and algorithms, honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. I am excited to delve into each task and share my insights and findings through this repository. If you find any of these tasks intriguing or beneficial, please consider giving the repository a star mark. Your support is greatly appreciated!
