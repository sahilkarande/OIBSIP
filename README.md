The Objective of this repository is to share the tasks assigned during my Oasis Infobyte internship in the field of data science. It serves as a platform to publish and showcase the projects and assignments I have completed throughout the internship. By making this repository accessible, I aim to demonstrate my skills and progress in data science to potential employers and the wider community. Additionally, it allows for collaboration and feedback from others interested in data science, fostering a learning and growth environment.

The tasks I have been assigned include:

Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Task 5: Sales Prediction using Python

These tasks provide an opportunity for me to apply various data science techniques and algorithms, honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. I am excited to delve into each task and share my insights and findings through this repository. If you find any of these tasks intriguing or beneficial, please consider giving the repository a star mark. Your support is greatly appreciated!
