Iris Flower Classification

What is Iris and what are its species?

Iris is a genus of flowering plants that belongs to the **family Iridaceae.

It had a diverse and widespread genus, known for its beautiful and showy flowers. 

In this project, I utilized various Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to load and 
manipulate the data. The data was visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to gain insights and better understand 
the patterns and characteristics of the Iris flowers.

For the classification task, I trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using the labeled data. The SVM algorithm is known for its effectiveness in handling classification
problems. I evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and conducted testing to ensure its accuracy.

The project focuses on classifying three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginia.

Iris has a genus of 300 Species of plants in family of Iridaceae.

Listed Species of Iris flower are:

1. Setosa: Setosa is often used as a species name in the biological classification of plants and animals. For example, "Iris setosa" is a species of iris, a type of flowering plant.
2. Versicolor: Versicolor is another species name commonly used in biological classification. For instance, "Lobelia versicolor" is a species of flowering plant.
3. Virginia: Virginia is a term that could refer to several things. It is often associated with the U.S. state of Virginia, or it could be a person's name. Additionally, there is a species of 
opossum called the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana).

I'm delighted to share that the model achieved an accuracy of 100% in classifying the Iris flowers correctly. The repository contains the 
code implementation, 
along with detailed documentation, to guide you through the project.
